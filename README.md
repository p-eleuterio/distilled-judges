What the Script Does
The script is designed to:

Classify whether a given text complies with the rules of a Reddit forum.

Explain the reasoning behind the classification using a Large Language Model (LLM) like Mistral-7B or LLaMA-2.

It combines classification and explanation into a single pipeline, leveraging the power of an LLM to provide human-like reasoning for its decisions.

Key Features
Authentication: Uses your Hugging Face API key to access gated models (e.g., Mistral-7B).

Prompt Engineering: Constructs a detailed prompt to guide the LLM in classifying and explaining the text.

Model Loading: Loads a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Mistral-7B or LLaMA-2) for text generation.

Output Parsing: Extracts the classification and explanation from the LLM's response.

How to Use the Script
1. Prerequisites
Python Environment: Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

Libraries: Install the required libraries:

$pip install transformers huggingface_hub python-dotenv
Hugging Face Account: Create an account on Hugging Face.
API Token: Generate a Hugging Face API token from your account settings.

2. Set Up the .env File
Create a .env file in the same directory as the script and add your Hugging Face API token:

HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=your_api_token_here

3. Run the Script
Save the script to a file, e.g., reddit_moderator.py, and run it:

python reddit_moderator.py

Script Workflow
--Load Environment Variables:
The script reads your Hugging Face API token from the .env file.
Authenticates with Hugging Face using the token.
--Load the Model:
Loads a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Mistral-7B or LLaMA-2) and its tokenizer.
--Define the Prompt:
Constructs a prompt that instructs the LLM to:
  - Classify the text as compliant or non-compliant.
  - Provide a step-by-step explanation for the classification.

--Generate Classification and Explanation:
Feeds the prompt to the LLM.
Generates a response containing the classification and explanation.
--Parse the Output:
Extracts the classification and explanation from the LLM's response.
--Display the Results:
Prints the input text, classification, and explanation.

Example Input and Output
Input:
python
Copy
text = "This post contains personal information about another user."
Output:
Copy
Text: This post contains personal information about another user.
Classification: non-compliant
Explanation: The text was classified as non-compliant because it contains personal information, which violates Rule 2 of the forum's guidelines. The mention of identifiable details about another user is a clear breach of privacy guidelines.
Customization
Model: Replace mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1 with another model (e.g., meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf).

Rules: Update the rules variable in the create_prompt function to reflect the specific rules of your Reddit forum.

Prompt: Modify the prompt to include more examples or additional instructions.

Summary
This script is a powerful tool for automating the moderation of Reddit forums. It:
Classifies text based on forum rules.
Provides detailed explanations for its decisions.
Can be customized and deployed for real-world use.
